Monad Project Structure Guide

Understanding the structure of a project helps contributors navigate and participate more effectively. Here's a simple breakdown of the typical Monad project structure:

/build
Contains compiled files and build artifacts. This folder is usually generated after running the build process and is not manually edited.

/contracts
Holds smart contract source code written for the Monad ecosystem. This is where the core logic and functionality of the project resides.

/scripts
Includes helpful scripts for deployment, testing, or automation. They assist in managing and interacting with smart contracts.

/tests
Contains test files used to validate the functionality and reliability of the contracts and scripts.

README.md
Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and other important documentation. Always check this first when starting with the repo.

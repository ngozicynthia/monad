Contracts Overview:

This document provides an overview of the smart contracts deployed within the Monad project, along with instructions for interaction.

Deployed Contracts

GMonad Contract  
Address: 0x72B3D4E7E241A7B4b656CbafC01a620cBE109BD7 
This contract is the core of Monadâ€™s token logic and management. It handles token deployment, transfers, and interactions.  

How to Interact with Contracts:
You can interact with these contracts using tools such as:  
Remix IDE: For deploying and testing Solidity contracts  
Owlto: A user-friendly interface for deploying tokens on Monad.

Deploying a contract is different from creating a token. Deploying involves uploading and activating the smart contract code on the blockchain.  
Creating a token usually requires using an existing contract with custom parameters. Owlto simplifies token creation by handling this process.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the Monad ecosystem by interacting with these contracts.
